With a few texts, your friends agree to back you up. After school gets out, you and your friends approach the troublemakers. You grab one of them and get in their face - the kid looks terrified; they probably didn't expect this when they started harassing your sister. You wind up to punch this twerp out when you hear shouting and heavy footsteps coming your way. The next thing you know, you're shoved to the ground with your face on the pavement.
