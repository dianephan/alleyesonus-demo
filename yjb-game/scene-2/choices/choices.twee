The drama is juicy and the fight is wild - loads of people have crowded in behind you just to get a look. 

"A video of [[this would get tons of attention online.|scene-2-short-a][$user.points = $user.points - 0]]" you think to yourself as you reach for your phone. You look around the crowd for your friends, but you can't find them. 
<<if $user.points >= 200>>
"[[I'll just catch a video for my friends|scene-2-short-b][$user.points = $user.points - 200]]; they'd love to have this view." 
<</if>>

<<if $user.points >= 370>> 
On second thought, you consider backing out of the crowd and finding your friends instead. 
Everyone has their phones out anyways, [[what good will one more video do?|scene-2-short-c][$user.points = $user.points - 370]]
